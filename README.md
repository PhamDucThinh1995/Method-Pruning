## What is pruning?
> Pruning is one of the method to optimize the model. Model pruning is the art of **discarding** those weights that do **not signify** a modelâ€™s performance. Carefully pruned networks lead to their better-compressed versions and they often become suitable for on-device deployment scenarios. It leads to a better accuracy of the model by Accelerating Inference. A tree that has too many branches and layers *can result* in overfitting of the training data.
> Pre-pruning: also known as Early Stopping Rule. Avoids generating overly complex subtrees which overfit the training data.
> Post-pruning: means to prune after the tree is built. You grow the tree entirely using your decision tree algorithm and then you prune the subtrees in the tree in a bottom-up fashion.
