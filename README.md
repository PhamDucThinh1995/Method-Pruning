## What is pruning?
> Pruning is one of the method to optimize the model. Model pruning is the art of **discarding** those weights that do **not signify** a modelâ€™s performance. Carefully pruned networks lead to their better-compressed versions and they often become suitable for on-device deployment scenarios. It leads to a better accuracy of the model by Accelerating Inference. A tree that has too many branches and layers *can result* in overfitting of the training data.
> 
> Pre-pruning: also known as Early Stopping Rule. Avoids generating overly complex subtrees which overfit the training data.
> 
> Post-pruning: means to prune after the tree is built. You grow the tree entirely using your decision tree algorithm and then you prune the subtrees in the tree in a bottom-up fashion.

## Difference between Pruning and Drop-out:
>**Dropout** is a well-known regularization method by sampling a sub-network from a larger deep neural network and training different sub-networks on different subsets of the data. 
>
>**Pruning** = post-hoc removal of nodes that you don't think are important. This way, only the "good" nodes remain.
>
>**Dropout** = each training observation uses only a subset of available nodes. This prevents the model from becoming overreliant on a couple strong nodes, and hopefully results in all nodes becoming equally "good".
>
>**Dropout** is temporary and random.
>
>**Pruning** is permanent and determined by an algorithm.
